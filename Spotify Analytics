--For this project, the following Spotify dataset was downloaded and opened in Numbers for viewing.
--Then I created a table by wiritng SQL with the column names & remaining data with SQLite Studio.
--Once completed, I analyzed the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table & explored the data using the following SQL. 

--To explore which track names were the top 10 most popular, I performed the following:
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

--Then I decided to see what which Ariana Grande song had the most danceability. 
SELECT artist_name , track_name ,avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Ariana Grande'
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
Order by avg(danceability) desc
limit 1
